Tom Stuart wrote a book called [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com/) in which he demonstrates many foundational ideas in computer science, such as finite automata and Turing machines not by mathematical or formal description, but by writing Ruby code to illustrate.

This repository ports many of those Ruby code examples into the Go programming language.
